Hi!

The following presents a model for predicting the number of
O-Rings in distress expected on a space shuttle flight. 

We actually trained two models, but here is just the first one :)

The models were trained on a dataset extracted from the UC Irvine ML Repository, 
which came to be because of the Challenger Launch disaster in 1986, 
where a shrinking of an O-Ring started a chain off event that ended with the destruction of the spacecraft.
